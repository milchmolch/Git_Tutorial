The README.md file is what is shown by default in the browser view of a repository, and standard to have in your GitHub project.
It’s basically just a text file that supports the Markdown syntax.

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub.  
To see the raw markdown of a page, in the browser click on the <Raw> button on the top of the page ([e.g. the main page of this tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milchmolch/Git_Tutorial/master/README.md))
