### The problem

- "The final version" from [PHD comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531)
<img src="finalDoc.gif" width="300">

- You want to improve a working script. After 2 hours of rewriting the new script still doesn't work. Unfortunately you overwrote
the original version that worked and can't go back. 

- Which version did I use 3 years ago when I did the analysis?


### The solution: versioning

Git/Github is increasingly used to handle research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts.
Git can be used to increase reproducibility, as a backup system against data loss, for facilitating collaboration or simply
if you are working on several computers. 

- giant undo button
- backup system against data loss  
  you can retrieve and compare versions
- collaboration - several people working on the same documents
- increase reproducibility
- you work on multiple computers  


Git is just one popular versioning system. 

Git is complicated and Learning git (and using) is sometimes frustrating.

### Installing git on the command line

In my opinion it is easier to learn git using the command line. After initial setup all we need for our daily work are 3 or 4 git commands -
with time we learn and memorize more commands. 
By using graphical interfaces there is a higher risk of using advanced commands without really knowing what they do.  
  
- Mac  
  Install Git from here: http://git-scm.com/downloads.  
  For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7) use the most recent available installer available [here](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list).
- Windows  
  Install Git for Windows by downloading and running [the installer](http://msysgit.github.io/). This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
- Linux  
  You can install it via your distribution's package manager. For Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git`.


### Installing Graphical Interfaces

We recommend [SourceTree (Mac, Windows)](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) and, for Linux, [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).
  
RStudio also comprises a basic git client.  
  
Because all of the clients are just forming and executing Git commands on your behalf, you donâ€™t have to pick one.  
You can literally do one operation from the command line, do another from RStudio, and another from SourceTree, one after the other, and it just works.

For a full list of available graphical interfaces, see http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis


### Installation problems

In case of installation problems, consult [this site](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html) and [this site](http://ttimbers.github.io/2015-04-30-SFU/).


### Setting up git

Configure git the first time is used on a computer.    
  
Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled
```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```

Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git commits.
```
git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
```
